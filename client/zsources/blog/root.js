my idea is to make live content as well as edit the content created from those streams to post on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUiaHldlB2GY5ovjRE6KFUQ">my youtube channel</a>
the content is mainly rocket league it seems...

this is the end of the "getting the basics" as today was the day that completed 1 year of taiko for me
this was the run, and now there is no more time objectives i want to accomplish

what i wanted was to be getting 98% on every type of 5.5* map, that didn't happen, but i got somewhere else:
i can play any 2* map and get SS
3* maps are FCable with an average of 99% acc
the lower half of 4* are FCable with an average 98%, there are map styles that are exceptions to this, but overall that's it
some from the 4*'s higher half are FCable, some with 99% some with 97%. there are some maps i can't pass, i get like 90% and fail. there are maps i feel are at my skill level, getting 95% with 1% of the notes being misses

thinking about this, what i feel is that the harder the map you play the more inconsistent it is to play it, and that is happening at an earlier stage for me, comparing to other players, probably because of my playstyle, as the maps start having weird things to read for full alt, like double notes and streams

and that's it, i think now i will finally be able to just play the game, and forget about trying to get better
i will probably just play whenever i would like to do so and will probably try other playstyles, like hitting big notes, crosstapping, kkdd, retrying tons of times the same map, playing for combo instead of accuracy, swap to 4 fingers, or even just keep playing like i play right now, who knows what else
but the most important thing is that i won't stop here, maybe i take a break, but i don't think i will quit soon, that very first objective of doing streams indefinitely is something i still want to be able to do some day

let's go

i feel like i got the taiko basics now, i can alternate everything if it is slow enough, but streams aren't easy at all yet
the thing is, i just feel like i don't know how to look at a stream when it comes, it looks like i just get lost on all those notes coming at once, and not only that, i need to keep doing it until the end...

TITLE> taiko hardships
p> it's just weird, i'm feeling i got worse on easier maps, i just can't get a 99% on a low 4* map, but i'm faster, so i can get 95% on some ~4.8*ish maps...
i just don't like this, i want to be consistent, be able to play every pattern that comes to me.
i hope this is just some weird thing my brain is doing, i'm not feeling well with my skills because of this. it would be weird if i say i'm trying hard, you know, but yeah, THAT'S JUST NOT HARD ENOUGH! C'MON! THIS IS EXACLY WHAT I WANTED, THE MOST DIFFICULT, YET POSSIBLE TEST I COULD HAVE ASKED ON A GAME:
BEING GOOD AT SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE ANY TALENT ON!!!!
LET'S GOOOOOOO
anyway, tomorrow is the big day to see the best taiko match i could ask for, brazil x japan, my 2 most favorite teams one against the other
i really want brazil to win, they are really good, and you know, there is something special about they winning this...

god, this took a while to accomplish. 500pp was never this "hard" to get. i wasn't trying to get pp but to get better, but still... the transition from muzukashii to oni is for sure my greatest wall to break through, and it seems that i will flow a lot better in my gameplay when i be consistent at "slaying demons"

i feel i'm reading a lot better double notes, like the introduction on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1202930#taiko/2505088">this map (Byakuya Gentou - Nekomata Master [Inner Oni])</a>, but this map specifically is just so techy to even pass right now...
other than that i'm proud to maintain this "1k plays every month" thing, because i feel like i was always doing things inconsistently, and taiko demands consistency (at least my playstyle and objective do)
but yeah, let's just remember that my pure objective in taiko is to just, consistently and effortlessly, read and play any pattern and longstreams with 1/4 notes on 180 bpm (the standard for drum and bass and other genres i like)

oh yeah, there is <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1395286">this map (AFRO KNUCKLE - Nekomata Master+ [Samba Oni])</a> that is just so fun to play (for now i have to slow it down 0.75 but it's so well mapped that it's yet really good). i wish i could be able also to play this and be able to do 99% accuracy...

i'm getting better at 1/4 patterns, but i just cannot do 1/4 streams at all, sometimes i'm able to but just when i get lucky, that's probably my next step, and it feels like i'm relearning 1/2 streams like 5-6 months ago.

i finished the beta version of my first beatmap <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1345653" >ayako saso - dodge life</a>
i'm starting to play the "real taiko" now... i mean, i can play (getting like 90%) things like <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/2661437" > Sewerslvt - Yandere Complex [Oni] </a> and <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1320778" >m-flo loves CHEMISTRY - Astrosexy [Cosmos]</a> that are super consistent maps on density
for example, yandere complex's oni has a lot of 1/2s with some triples between, but that's an oni level, so you get a map with only 1/2s and triples with really hard patterns, and they won't repeat at all apparently...
the other one, we got no patterns at all, both for note color and note frequency... so you got something like this kddkd kdkk kkd dkdkk dk d dkdkkkd kkddkdk kkkdd dkd dd kkdkd kkd and i can get 90-93% accuracy consistently on this type of maps
and these examples are consistent maps that truly show your capacity at getting through a random beatmap style at low 4* maps, so basically i'm getting 90-95% on low 4 stars maps, and these have a lot of 1/4s training so with them i can get ready for 5* maps. and i think 5* (or high 4*) are just 4* but faster and with streams longer than 10 notes sometimes
meaning i need to get consistent at reading 1/4 streams for some seconds, like in the picture below even if the bpm is 128
<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1331624" >IOSYS - Endless Tewi-ma Park [Oni]</a>
<img src="zsources/blog/img/799419934530207754.png" >
and to be honest... that's what i want for taiko, to be able to read 1/4 streams for eternity
those are my thoughts for the future now

for example, <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/2462306">maps like this</a>. even though that beatmap is 136 bpm, the notes are 1/3, which makes it the same as 204 bpm with 1/2 notes.

i'm starting also to be able to do triple patterns a lot more consistently.
and i started to think about changing my playstyle to 4 finger, but that's not gonna happen, i will be playing taiko the way i think is the best for fun! that is 2 finger full alt.

TITLE> let me present you: SCREEN DATA CAPTURE DESIGN
p> data capture is something really present to us, internet users, nowadays.

before internet, it was so hard to get info about everyone that used something you created, but nowadays is simple, you can store if someone clicked a button or something like that if you know a bit of social media marketing + web development or equivalent.

in the game osu! you have a pretty good example of this:

<img src="zsources/blog/img/766514897630003250.png">

but let's simplify that:

<img src="zsources/blog/img/766517343730794526.png">

<img src="zsources/blog/img/766517904362438676.png">

here (in purple) we have the score section. there you can click to see more details about a score. clicking you go to this screen:

<img src="zsources/blog/img/766521204194279434.png">

here you have the back button on the left and the watch button on the right. the design of the screens here is in a way that the user can't miss click the WATCH button to watch the replay without going from the left to the right of the screen.

that's something that mobile apps and webapps aren't doing at all, even though they want to get information about where the user is heading at towards the app usage path.

i think we should have a design that should be simple and intuitive, but at the same time, prevent miss clicks from the user so they can have a better experience with the app and so apps can track better their users.

TITLE> my solution for the FizzBuzz test
p> today i worked on a test mentioned in <a href="https://youtu.be/QPZ0pIK_wsc">this video by Tom Scott

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QPZ0pIK_wsc/maxresdefault.jpg">
</a>

the first button shows what i have done in 2-3 minutes, and the other one shows a better version of it.

<a href="other/FizzBuzz.html">here</a> you can see the result

what i noticed about my coding style is that i like to think ahead into the future. i was asking myself if i should simplify the code a little more and i was worried about someone trying to understand my code and if to change something was easy to do. that's why i tried to make a code fast and after that works i tried to make it better.

at the same time, you can see with the first try that i did not output exactly what was proposed. i output "3" instead of "Fizz", "5" instead of "Buzz" and "3 e 5" instead of "FizzBuzz". that's something i could work on from now on.

eu ganhei pp e parece que a maioria perdeu bastante pp, por isso acabei subindo de 18k pra 10k
